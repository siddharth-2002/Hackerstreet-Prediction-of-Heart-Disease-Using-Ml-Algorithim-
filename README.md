The full code for this article can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l3Pjn7bKTpBlpwkYnIyf0TXd1ww7Xdhi#scrollTo=7DcSgEZEeOB-). It is implemented in Python and different classification algorithms are used. Below is a brief description of the general approach that I employed:

🎫Data cleaning and pre-processing: 

Here we checked and dealt with missing and duplicate variables from the data set as these can grossly affect the performance of different machine learning algorithms (many algorithms do not tolerate missing data).

📰🌡Exploratory Data Analysis:

Here we wanted to gain important statistical insights from the data and the things that I checked for were the distributions of the different attributes, correlations of the attributes with each other and the target variable and I calculated important odds and proportions for the categorical attributes.
Feature Selection: Since having irrelevant features in a data set can decrease the accuracy of the models applied, I used the Boruta Feature Selection technique to select the most important features which were later used to build different models.

🧪Model development and comparison: 

we  used three classification models, i.e., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees , After which we compared the performance of the models using their accuracy and F1 scores.  then we settled with the best performing model.
